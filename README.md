# Volume-Hand-Control
This code is a Python application that uses hand gesture recognition to control the system's volume level in real-time.


I am writing this code to dedicate to my loving partner ‚ù§Ô∏è
The idea came whe she use to use the Discord Volume control button  to lower my channel volume when I used to talk to irritate her.
I have made this easy for her, now she can do this using simple hand ü§è gestures.

Check the compatible Python version with OpenCV before using the code.
